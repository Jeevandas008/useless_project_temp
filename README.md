# [WrongGPT] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [UNSTOPPABLE]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Jeevan Das C K] - [Jyothi Engineering College]
- Member 2: [Enosh P R] - [Jyothi Engineering College]

### Project Description
[WrongGPT is a completely unreliable AI chatbot that proudly gives hilariously wrong answers to any question. Ask it anything ‚Äî math, history, geography ‚Äî and get answers so confidently wrong, you might start doubting reality.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[In today‚Äôs world, AI is getting too smart. It‚Äôs answering correctly, helping people learn, and generally ruining the vibe for lazy students. Who will stand up for the right to be wrong?]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We built WrongGPT ‚Äî the AI that proudly delivers wrong answers, fake facts, and absurd logic. Need to fail an exam in record time? Want to win an argument by making the other person question their own sanity? WrongGPT has your back.]
